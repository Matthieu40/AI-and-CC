In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.
"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."
He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined to reserve all judgements, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought — frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon — for the intimate revelations of young me nor at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested and I snobbishly repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parceled out unequally at birth.
And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction — Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the "creative temperament" — it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No — Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.
My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today.
I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look like him — with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father's office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe — so I decided to go east and learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said "Why — ye-es" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.
The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.
It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.
"How do you get to West Egg Village?" he asked helplessly.
I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.
And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees — just as things grow in fast movies — I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.
There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides. I was rather literary in college — one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the "Yale News" — and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the "well-rounded" man. This isn't just an epigram — life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.
It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals — like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end — but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless amore arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size.
I lived at West Egg, the — well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard — it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion. Or rather, as I didn't know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn and the consoling proximity of millionaires — all for eighty dollars a month.
Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I'd known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven — a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterwards savours of anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy — even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach — but now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.
Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe it — I had no sight into Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.

Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East
Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer
really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner
with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed
and I'd known Tom in college. And just after the war I spent two
days with them in Chicago.
Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been
one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New
Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach
such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything
afterward savors of anti-climax. His family were enormously

Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year in
France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and
there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich
together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the
telephone, but I didn't believe it--I had no sight into Daisy's
heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a
little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some
irrecoverable football game.
And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to
East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.
Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful
red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay. The
lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a
quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and
burning gardens--finally when it reached the house drifting up
the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.
The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now
with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon,
and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs
apart on the front porch.
He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy,
straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a
supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant eyes had established
dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always
leaning aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of
his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--
he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the
top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting
when his shoulder moved under his thin coat. It was a body
capable of enormous leverage--a cruel body.
His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression
of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal
contempt in it, even toward people he liked--and there were men
at New Haven who had hated his guts.
"Now, don't think my opinion on these matters is final," he
seemed to say, "just because I'm stronger and more of a man than
you are." We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were
never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of 
me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant
wistfulness of his own.
We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.
"I've got a nice place here," he said, his eyes flashing about
restlessly.
Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along
the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden,
a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat
that bumped the tide off shore.
"It belonged to Demaine the oil man." He turned me around again,
politely and abruptly. "We'll go inside."
We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored
space,fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either
end.The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh
grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A
breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and
out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the
frosted wedding cake of the ceiling--and then rippled over the
wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.
The only completely stationary object in the room was an
enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though
upon an anchored balloon. They were both in white and their
dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been
blown back in after a short flight
around the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening
to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture
on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear
windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the
curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly
to the floor.
The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended
full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and
with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something
on it which was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the
corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it--indeed, I was almost
surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by
coming in.
The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise--she leaned
slightly forward with a conscientious expression--then she 
laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and
came forward into the room.
"I'm p-paralyzed with happiness."
She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held
my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that
there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That
was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of
the balancing girl was Baker. (I've heard it said that Daisy's
murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant
criticism that made it no less charming.)
At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost
imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again--the
object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and
given her something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose
to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency
draws a stunned tribute from me.
I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her
low,thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear
follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes
that will never be played again. Her face was sad and lovely
with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate
mouth--but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had
cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a
whispered "Listen," a promise that she had done gay, exciting
things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting
things hovering in the next hour.
I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way
east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.
"Do they miss me?" she cried ecstatically.
"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear
wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a
persistent wail all night along the North Shore."


About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York
arrived one morning at Gatsby's door and asked him if he had
anything to say.
"Anything to say about what?" inquired Gatsby politely.
"Why,--any statement to give out."
It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had
heard Gatsby's name around his office in a connection which he
either wouldn't reveal or didn't fully understand. This was his
day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out "to
see."
It was a random shot, and yet the reporter's instinct was right.
Gatsby's notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had
accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past,
had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news.
Contemporary legends such as the "underground pipe-line to
Canada" attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent
story that he didn't live in a house at all, but in a boat that
looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long
Island shore. Just why North Dakota, isn't easy to say.
James Gatz--that was really, or at least legally, his name. He
had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific
moment that witnessed the beginning of his career--when he saw
Dan Cody's yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on
Lake Superior. It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the
beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas
pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat,
pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might
catch him and break him up in half an hour.
I suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then.
His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people--his
imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at
all. The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island,
sprang from his Platonic conception of himself. He was a son of
God--a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that--and
he must be about His Father's Business, the service of a vast,
vulgar and meretricious beauty. So he invented just the sort of
Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be
likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the
end.
For over a year he had been beating his way along the south
shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or
in any other capacity that brought him food and bed. His brown,
hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half
lazy work of the bracing days. He knew women early and since
they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young
virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they
were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming selfabsorption he took for granted.
But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most
grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at
night. A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his
brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon
soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor. Each
night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness
closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace. For
a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination;
they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a
promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a
fairy's wing.
An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months
before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern
Minnesota. He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious
indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and
despising the janitor's work with which he was to pay his way
through. Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still
searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody's yacht
dropped anchor in the shallows along shore.
Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver
fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventyfive. The transactions in Montana copper that made him many
times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge
of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of
women tried to separate him from his money. The none too savory
ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played
Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and sent him
to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid
journalism of 1902. He had been coasting along all too
hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James
Gatz's destiny at Little Girl Bay.
To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the
railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in 
the world. I suppose he smiled at Cody--he had probably
discovered that people liked him when he smiled. At any rate
Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand
new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly
ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him
a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap.
And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary
Coast Gatsby left too.
He was employed in a vague personal capacity--while he remained
with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and
even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody
drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies
by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement
lasted five years during which the boat went three times around
the continent. It might have lasted indefinitely except for the
fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week
later Dan Cody inhospitably died.
I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey,
florid man with a hard empty face--the pioneer debauchee who
during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern
seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.
It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little.
Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub
champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of
letting liquor alone.
And it was from Cody that he inherited money--a legacy of
twenty-five thousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never
understood the legal device that was used against him but what
remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye. He was left
with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of
Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man.
He told me all this very much later, but I've put it down here
with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his
antecedents, which weren't even faintly true. Moreover he told
it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of
believing everything and nothing about him. So I take advantage
of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his
breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.
It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. For
several weeks I didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone—
mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying 
to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally I went
over to his house one Sunday afternoon. I hadn't been there two
minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink. I was
startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it
hadn't happened before.
They were a party of three on horseback--Tom and a man named
Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been
there previously.
"I'm delighted to see you," said Gatsby standing on his porch.
"I'm delighted that you dropped in."
As though they cared!
"Sit right down. Have a cigarette or a cigar." He walked around
the room quickly, ringing bells. "I'll have something to drink
for you in just a minute."
He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there. But
he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something,
realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for. Mr.
Sloane wanted nothing. A lemonade? No, thanks. A little
champagne? Nothing at all, thanks. . . . I'm sorry----
"Did you have a nice ride?"
"Very good roads around here."
"I suppose the automobiles----"
"Yeah."
Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had
accepted the introduction as a stranger.
"I believe we've met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan."
"Oh, yes," said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not
remembering.
"So we did. I remember very well."
"About two weeks ago."
"That's right. You were with Nick here."
"I know your wife," continued Gatsby, almost aggressively.
"That so?"
Tom turned to me.
"You live near here, Nick?"
"Next door."
"That so?"
Mr. Sloane didn't enter into the conversation but lounged back
haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either--until
unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial.
"We'll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby," she
suggested.
"What do you say?"
"Certainly. I'd be delighted to have you."
"Be ver' nice," said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude. "Well--think
ought to be starting home."
"Please don't hurry," Gatsby urged them. He had control of
himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom. "Why don't you--
why don't you stay for supper? I wouldn't be surprised if some
other people dropped in from New York."
"You come to supper with ME," said the lady enthusiastically.
"Both of you."
This included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.
"Come along," he said--but to her only.
"I mean it," she insisted. "I'd love to have you. Lots of room."
Gatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn't
see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn't.
"I'm afraid I won't be able to," I said.
"Well, you come," she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.
Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.
"We won't be late if we start now," she insisted aloud.
"I haven't got a horse," said Gatsby. "I used to ride in the
army but I've never bought a horse. I'll have to follow you in
my car. Excuse me for just a minute."
The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the
lady began an impassioned conversation aside.
"My God, I believe the man's coming," said Tom. "Doesn't he know
she doesn't want him?"
"She says she does want him."
"She has a big dinner party and he won't know a soul there." He
frowned.
"I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy. By God, I may be
old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these
days to suit me. They meet all kinds of crazy fish."
Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and
mounted their horses.
"Come on," said Mr. Sloane to Tom, "we're late. We've got to
go." And then to me: "Tell him we couldn't wait, will you?"
Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and
they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the
August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in
hand came out the front door.


It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth
with Dan Cody--told it to me because "Jay Gatsby" had broken up
like glass against Tom's hard malice and the long secret
extravaganza was played out. I think that he would have
acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to
talk about Daisy.
She was the first "nice" girl he had ever known. In various
unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people
but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her
excitingly desirable. He went to her house, at first with other
officers from Camp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him--he had
never been in such a beautiful house before. But what gave it an
air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there--it was
as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.
There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs
more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant
activities taking place through its corridors and of romances
that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh
and breathing and redolent of this year's shining motor cars and
of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered. It excited him
too that many men had already loved Daisy--it increased
her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all about the
house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still
vibrant emotions.
But he knew that he was in Daisy's house by a colossal accident.
However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at
present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment
the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his
shoulders. So he made the most of his time. He took what he
could get, ravenously and unscrupulously--eventually he took
Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real
right to touch her hand.
He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her
under false pretenses. I don't mean that he had traded on his
phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of
security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the
same stratum as herself--that he was fully able to take care of
her. As a matter of fact he had no such facilities--he had no
comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the
whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the
world.
But he didn't despise himself and it didn't turn out as he had
imagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and
go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the
following of a grail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but
he didn't realize just how extraordinary a "nice" girl could be.
She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life,
leaving Gatsby--nothing. He felt married to her, that was all.
When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was
breathless, who was somehow betrayed. Her porch was bright with
the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee
squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her
curious and lovely mouth. She had caught a cold and it made her
voice huskier and more charming
than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and
mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of
many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud
above the hot struggles of the poor.
"I can't describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved
her, old sport. I even hoped for a while that she'd throw me
over, but she didn't, because she was in love with me too. She
thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her. .
. . Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in
love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn't care. What was
the use of doing great things if I could have a better time
telling her what I was going to do?"
On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in
his arms for a long, silent time. It was a cold fall day with
fire in the room and her cheeks flushed. Now and then she moved
and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark
shining hair. The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while
as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next
day promised. They had never been closer in their month of love
nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she
brushed silent lips against his coat's shoulder or when he
touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were
asleep.
He did extraordinarily well in the war. He was a captain before
he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got
his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns.
After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some 
complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead. He
was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in
Daisy's letters. She didn't see why he couldn't come. She was
feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see
him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she
was doing the right thing after all.
For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of
orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set
the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and
suggestiveness of life in new tunes. All night the saxophones
wailed the hopeless comment of the "Beale Street Blues" while a
hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining
dust. At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed
incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted
here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around
the floor.
Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with
the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a
day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the
beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying
orchids on the floor beside her bed. And all the time something
within her was crying for a decision. She wanted her life shaped
now, immediately--and the decision must be made by some force--
of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that was
close at hand.
That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival
of Tom Buchanan. There was a wholesome bulkiness about his
person and his position and Daisy was flattered. Doubtless there
was a certain struggle and a certain relief. The letter reached
Gatsby while he was still at Oxford.


One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking
ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his
hands out a little from his body as if to fight off
interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting
itself to his restless eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid
overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of
a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out
his hand.
"What's the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with
me?"
"Yes. You know what I think of you."
"You're crazy, Nick," he said quickly. "Crazy as hell. I don't
know what's the matter with you."
"Tom," I inquired, "what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?"
He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right
about those missing hours. I started to turn away but he took a
step after me and grabbed my arm.
"I told him the truth," he said. "He came to the door while we
were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we
weren't in he tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy
enough to kill me if I hadn't told him who owned the car. His
hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute he was in the
house----" He broke off defiantly.
"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He
threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy's but he was
a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you'd run over a dog and
never even stopped his car."
There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact
that it wasn't true.
"And if you think I didn't have my share of suffering--look
here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of
dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried
like a baby. By God it was awful----"
I couldn't forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had
done was, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless 
and confused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy--they
smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into
their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that
kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they
had made. . . .
I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt
suddenly as though I were talking to a child. Then he went into
the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace--or perhaps only a
pair of cuff buttons--rid of my provincial squeamishness
forever.
Gatsby's house was still empty when I left--the grass on his
lawn had grown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the
village never took a fare past the entrance gate without
stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who
drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the
accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own. I
didn't want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the
train.
I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,
dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could
still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from
his garden and the cars going up and down his drive. One night I
did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his
front steps. But I didn't investigate. Probably it was some
final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and
didn't know that the party was over.
On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the
grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure
of a house once more. On the white steps an obscene word,
scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in
the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along
the stone. Then I wandered down to the
beach and sprawled out on the sand.
Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were
hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat
across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential
houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the
old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a
fresh, green breast of the new world. Its vanished trees, the
trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in
whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams;
for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath
in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic
contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face
for the last time in history with something commensurate to his
capacity for wonder.
And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought
of Gatsby's wonder when he first picked out the green light at
the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to this blue
lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could
hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already
behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the
city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under
the night.
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that
year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no
matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms
farther. . . . And one fine morning----
So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly
into the past.
